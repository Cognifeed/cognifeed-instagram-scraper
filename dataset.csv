Check out The Plastic Diaries on the @envirodefence website to learn more about what you can do to end plastic pollution. 
It’s easy to feel responsible for the plastic mess we find ourselves in and naturally, we feel a sense of responsibility to clean it up. But plastic pollution is not your fault and you certainly can’t solve it alone.

Individual action can only do so much. It’s practically impossible to avoid plastics, and no matter how diligent of a recycler you may be, most plastic doesn’t even get recycled. In a world practically covered in non-recyclable plastic, doing ‘the right thing” can be a challenge. 
For almost 50 years, the plastics industry has strategically shifted the blame of plastic waste onto us – the consumers. Rather than invest in designing products to be recyclable, the plastics industry throws a few dollars into educating consumers on how to recycle properly, or they sponsor a few beach cleanups. And in the meantime, they fight against any laws that would force them to deal with the mess they made. 
Individuals all have a responsibility to care about the health of our planet and to drastically reduce how much plastic we use in the first place. But individual behaviour will have minor impacts without regulation. To avoid the needless creation of plastic waste that will stick around for hundreds of years, we need the government to step up and take meaningful action.

Here you go Daily Mail, have this information for free the next time you want to takedown an eco-activist. This year so far, I have taken 1 long-haul and 2 short-haul return trips with the 3rd coming up. That's a whole lot of emissions being created - roughly 2.767 tonnes of CO2 for a single traveler. (See a photo on @earthbyhelena's feed for a visual of 1 tonne 😬).⁣⁣ I'm sharing this because I want to be transparent as possible.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
🇺🇸 The long-haul was my first long-haul trip since 2001 and was in the name of a long distance friendship. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
🇳🇱 Flying to Amsterdam was something I could have avoided which is why I am now making a commitment to turn down any future work opportunities that mean flying. I did this recently when I was offered to represent Gen Z at a corporate event in Budapest. Even though they *so badly* wanted to have me speak, doing it remotely and saving the emissions wasn't enough... for a sustainability event 😆.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
♥️ The main reason I fly, though? Family. My parents are currently abroad which means if I want to see them, flying is the cheapest and easiest option. I don't want to make excuses. The price and ease (for an anxious solo-traveller) are the reason I haven't been by train before.⁣
⁣
So, I don't know if I can commit to not flying completely, yet. If it wasn't for people I love living far away, then I wouldn't question it. We're so lucky to live in a time when digital communication exists so we can at least stay connected in that way, without causing more damage to our future (and present).⁣
⁣⁣
When following the likes of @treesnpeace, @earthwandress and even @gretathunberg though, I think 2020 will be the year I give travelling by train some serious thought... 😬✈️⁣⁣

No. Why? Because I've been doing this since I can remember! Second-hand shopping is so engrained in me by now that no such challenge is necessary although of course, I absolutely advocate it for everyone else.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
I'm reposting these clips from my Story as a lottttt of you were impressed/inspired by me taking two pieces that cost me €1 each and making them fit me like a glove. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
See, the thing is with second-hand clothes is that not everything is perfect. The rails aren't organised, the prices are all over the place (for no rhyme or reason!) and you often find something you like that ends up being 10 sizes too big/small. But... we have to let go of perfection it we want to have a chance of turning this climate crisis thing around. (And as we all know by now, fashion isn't perfect in the first place - hence why second-hand is the way to go). ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Even if you don't have access to a sewing machine or the time to learn - remember that there is so much we can do with those seemingly imperfect items waiting to be re-homed. How to do it? Here:⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
✂️ Support your local tailor/repairer by taking your second-hand finds in for a fix-up or re-sizing, if you're able to.⁣⁣⁣
🤝 Have a friend/family member who's a sewer? Ask for a hand! ⁣⁣⁣
🤔 Think about how you can wear something differently. Not everything has to fit perfectly or be ""flattering"" to look awesome. Get creative!⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Second-hand shopping takes more time, especially if you look past the items that are already raring to go but that's the kind of slowing down we need. #SecondhandSeptember should be all year round - just sayin' 💁🖐️🥈⁣⁣⁣

And then you know you’re winning!
I have Asperger’s syndrome and that means I’m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And - given the right circumstances - being different is a superpower.

I'm not public about my diagnosis to ""hide"" behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an ""illness"", or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before. Before I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn’t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder.
All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems meaningless to so many people. #aspiepower #neurodiverse #npf",26211,885851,gretathunberg

Thing is, I believe if we face our #foodstyling fears they become less scary 👻. Plus going where most don’t dare to go makes us stand out💪🏼. Besides, I love the idea of having creative pioneers in the studio💁🏽‍♀️💓.

⁣
Second-hand sales like the one I just searched through in Ostuni, Italy, make it so incredibly clear how many perfectly usable clothes there are available to us that don't require virgin materials or unethical working conditions to acquire. ⁣⁣
⁣
It baffles my mind to think that by 2030, an estimated 500 billion t-shirts 👕 may have been produced (according to the EAC Fixing Fashion inquiry), globally, when we have access to so many perfectly usable ones already. Sure, they might not be in trend or be squeaky clean and new but when we're experiencing a Climate Emergency, it makes you wonder how important trends and 'newness' really are. (Ahem, not at all.)⁣⁣
⁣
We need a mass shift in mindset because, in the words of Macklemore, one man's trash is another man's come up.⁣⁣
⁣
I do understand that there are limitations to second-hand shopping but I also know that there are many people (probably reading this!) who have the time and ability to swap it out for fast-fashion and buying new. Trust me, it's so much more fun and rewarding... and FYI - my blouse and shorts are an example. 👟🛍️⁣⁣

Super easy recipe and tastes sooo good!
2 cups kale
1 cup basil 
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds 
1/4 cup nutritional yeast 
2 cloves garlic 
Juice of 1 lemon 
Salt & Pepper
1/3 cup olive oil. 
Mix everything in a food processor or blender and mix until everything is combined! Adding the olive oil gradually is the way to go but I usually just mix it all at once and it comes out perfectly!",88,4179,plantbasedjane

I’m not a Hong Konger.  For the short four years that I’ve lived here, I’m not even eligible for permanent residency. ⁣
⁣⁣
⁣I was born in Taiwan.  A country where the gift of democracy has  been pre-paid for, by many generations before me, by strangers in the distant past who have laid down their lives so I, and you, and all the ambiguous individual far far into the unknown future, could maybe, maybe have a say, a voice, a vote in the system that none of us can choose to be born into.  It’s a birthright that many of us have taken for granted, that many of us are too fortunate to have forgotten, that democracy had never come without a price.⁣
⁣⁣
⁣If you haven’t already heard, Hong Kong has been, for the past few months, in a uprising and sometimes violent battle for democracy against the authoritarian central government of China.  They call it, the revolution of their time.  A seemingly hopeless dignity.  I don’t know what will happen, nobody does, but I can only wish that whatever voice I am granted with in this world of social media, could help their voice be heard from a little bit further.  Because I believe that authoritarianism only looks strong but is truthfully fragile.  That once there is a crack, anything is possible.  Share if you agree. ⁣

It is the ultimate tell of someone losing their argument.  I’m not saying this to upset anyone. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣I’m simply saying this because I want to bring to light for the commenters who were angered by my last post, that the fact they are able to criticize in this space is a direct result of the very thing that they are criticizing against.  That the right of saying what they said in the place where they said it, is the fruit of the fundamental values of democracy.  To say democracy is not valid is to say that their comments are not valid, and hence saying nothing. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣Those who screamed against the desire for democracy in their comments, are already practicing democracy without knowing. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣So welcome.  You are already one of us. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣But democracy only works on the ground of - amongst other things - freedom of information and speech.  And a well-informed speech can only be constructed and effectively delivered through facts, reasons, and the willingness to understand, sometimes even empathize with the opposition argument.  So practice it.  If you are already on Instagram, then it means you are treading beyond the firewall of censored internet in China, meaning that you already wanting more, that you have access to Google, to more than one side of the history, to the free-ranging vastness of informations, knowledge, philosophies and perspectives, the wilderness of forming your own thoughts, as scary as it is, as far as the willingness of your mind will take you. ⁣
⁣⁣
⁣So go search, absorb, struggle, evolve, and form your opinion with this powerful tool that is outlawed by the system that you are currently defending.  Be smart, be civil, convince me!  And as you are doing it, know that, hey, that good feeling that you are experiencing right now, that is what the Hong Kong people are fighting for for the next generations to come. ⁣⁣

2. Bread (two slices)
3. Tempeh bacon
4. Lettuce 
5. Chive vegan mayo
Cook veggie burger according to package instructions (or in the air fryer like I did), and prepare your tempeh bacon. Mix vegan mayo with sliced fresh chives and assemble your sandwich! I recommend having the lettuce closest to the two slices of bread to avoid it from getting soggy! I served it with some carrots, fruit & pretzels. However the sides are totally up to you!

There are times when we have to look at our Earth and draw a hard line on our values- is a forest’s value merely the sum of its raw materials like oil, lumber, farmable land? Or is it synergistic, greater than the sum of its parts because of the native peoples, the endless discoveries waiting to be found, the wonderful interactions like butterflies drinking the tears of turtles on the side of the river?
If you want to take a stand this week, there are some fantastic organizations to follow that can show you the way.
@rainforestalliance is THE leader in certifying sustainable products, from coffee to palm oil to even toilet paper! Buying @rainforestalliance certified products does well for the people and the forests.
@amazonwatch is a long-time superhero advocate for indigenous rights in the Amazon. They do such important work across the region fighting the good fight via advocacy in government and in court.
@rainforestactionnetwork has done an excellent job buying tracts of land for conservation and so much more.
I filmed this interaction of butterflies drinking turtle tears last year in Peru and it still blows my mind looking at it and realizing the rainforest is like a real-life Disney movie. But we can’t let the bad guys win. 🦋🌿✊🏼",55,2591,phil_torres

With sense of humor! Can you imagine having your teeth jet through your gums? Sooo gnarly 
2. Give lots of love! Cuddle and play as much as possible to comfort them!
3. Distract them- go outside, go for a walk, find puppies and play with leaves!
4. Put baby in a bath or sink to play through out the day (this is our fav thing to do lately at home)
5. I am a true believer in Amber Beads! Before we had the necklace he cried when he felt them push in, now he’s doing this-laughing! Haha (we got ours from @summerandstorm!) 6. Bits of frozen fruit to suck on. I like using pieces of grapes the most because they don’t mush into a big mess.
7. For all my kids no teething toy works so save your moola! (Unless you know a good one to recommend?) wet clean  wash clothes are magic tho right??
8. It’s good for them to gnaw on things, helps get those teeth through so we let him gnaw on our knuckles and knees and give him cold apples, and really anything he wants and is safe! Anything but my nipples 😭😭😭😭) he has 4 teeth coming in right now! 
9. For the parents- if you’re borderline zombie and feeling like your falling apart- try and take turns to get a little alone time and recharge. This is soooo important to me to be the best mom I can. Almost every day I do something for 45-1 hour for me, by myself. Its good for you and it’s good for your family! If I have to do it at 5 am to get this time I do it. And for me it’s exercise that keeps me feeling good, (and actually gives me a lot of energy) but for someone else that might be taking a nap, or going for lunch or whatever! 
Anyways I hope you enjoyed these tips! If you have some to add or find any of these to work for you do share for all the mammas wondering!!",319,22468,earthyandy

Ingredients
* 1/2 tbsp avocado oil (or cooking oil of choice or sub vegetable broth for oil-free)
* 1/2 cup diced onion
* 1/4 cup diced red or green bell pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
* 1 cup long-grain white rice
* 1 cup vegan chicken broth
* 1 cup tomato sauce
* 3/4 tsp chili powder
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp dried oregano
* Freshly ground black pepper, as desired
* 2-3 tbsp freshly chopped cilantro
* Lime wedges (to serve)

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add in the avocado oil. Once heated, add the bell pepper, onions, and garlic and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. If you would like, you can use vegetable broth instead of oil. We recommend adding 2 tablespoons of broth (in addition to the 1 cup used in the recipe) to cook the peppers, onions and garlic until soft, adding 2 tablespoons more at a time when needed to prevent burning.
2. Add in the uncooked rice and cook, stirring frequently, until toasted or about 3 minutes.
3. Add in all of the remaining ingredients, except for the cilantro and lime, and stir until well combined.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot and cook until all of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice, or about 16 to 18 minutes.
5. Once cooked, remove the pot from heat and allow it to sit, covered, for 4 minutes. Remove the lid and fluff the rice up.
6. Mix the cilantro into the rice and serve warm with lime if desired.

Note: The liquid required may vary depending on the rice used. We recommend you follow the directions specific to the rice that you are using to guarantee success. For example, if the rice calls for 2 cups liquid per every 1 cup rice, we suggest you use 1 cup broth and 1 cup tomato sauce. If the rice calls for 1 3/4 cups liquid per 1 cup rice, use 1 cup broth and 3/4 cup tomato sauce. Shoutout to @FiveHeartHome for this tip!

On the board we included tofu scramble (recipe on our blog), homemade vegan hollandaise with Maille Dijon (recipe on our blog), fresh berries, hazelnuts, microgreens, Maille cornichons, avocado, mini bagels, waffles, crackers, vegan American cheese, vegan cream cheese, and vegan sausage. Plus, from now until 9/22 you can save $1.00 on any (1) Maille product (Mustard/Pickles) at Albertsons or Safeway 🤘🏻 #ad #TheDifferenceIsAllMaille #Albertsons #Safeway #sweetsimplevegan #crueltyfreecharcuterie",73,3164,sweetsimplevegan

It's proof that activists (whatever that word means to you) may not always be shouting from the rooftops (or timelines) about every bit of action they take.⁣
⁣
@ajabarber made a point about this a while ago because it's not about doing it in order to get a pat on the back and a gold star. You just do the work, even if it's quietly and in the background. ⁣
⁣
I've also started to notice the expectation for me (and others) to cover ~all~ environmental stories and be able to offer support for ~all~ different kinds of issues because obviously, using my platform for good is of utmost importance to me. However, that's kind of impossible and also quite a pressure to put on someone via an Instagram DM 😅⁣
⁣
So - just letting you know, even if I'm quiet from time-to-time, I am likely very much still cracking on behind the scenes, which is a development over the past year that I'm really glad and proud of! ⛅😚⁣

colorful, nutritious, plant based meals, IN MAUI of all places, inspired the creation of my blog in the first place!
i go in and out of sharing a lot of recipes here for a few reasons...
one is because my blog has evolved a lot over the years and i really enjoy sharing lifestyle content (i.e. my life, my love, spirituality, my podcast, etc.) with you all.
also though, there can be a lot of judgment from others about an SOS-free plant based diet.
it gets old real quick.
sometimes i enjoy keeping my diet to myself because the judgment can be a lot to take in, but at the end of the day i feel a profound sense of motivation to share how much i have been impacted by this way of life over the last few years.
salt, oil, sugar free PLANT 🌱 foods have been a major, i mean major, part of my healing journey from lyme and the debilitating symptoms that come along with it.
this diet has also been extremely liberating for me in healing from the eating disorder i has years ago — plant foods heal me, mind body and soul. there is so much more i want to share with you about that.
and now more than ever i’m feeling a huge surge of inspiration to get back to my roots, to share more with you all about ALL of that, despite what some people may think.
you here for it?
what recipes would you like to see most?

Essentially, they are brand new recipes that are NOT in the book, but will need a crucial component from the book to be completed which, as you spit, yes, won’t be out until Oct 15. Yes again.⁣
⁣⁣
⁣The first recipe in this new series is, The Hulk, dry-fried green hot wings that uses fried chili verde sauce (in the book) as its base, and several other green herbs to bring a grassy, fragrant and complex flavor profile to this painfully pleasurable party. Within its smooth and creamy texture, the sauce delivers a forceful, savory and mouthwatering pepperiness, with just enough punishing heat for your naughty needs, and did I mention, the extra-browns browned butter that is poured on at the end because really, what are hot wings without butter?⁣

I don’t think I’ve mentioned that online simply because it’s normal to me so not something I actively think about all too often.

Having dyslexia means I process information differently. Growing up and going to schools that teach in a way that don’t match my learning style was challenging and I often felt less intelligent than other students. I gravitated towards the subjects I was naturally gifted at like art, creative writing, photography, psychology and critical thinking. Maths and chemistry felt like foreign languages that got me tongue-tied. It wasn’t until I understood dyslexia that it all made sense and I discovered better habits to support me in learning in ways that suit my processing system through an environment not designed for people like me with minds like mine.

Now that I’m self-employed I have control over how I schedule my day, complete my work and learn new skills. And over the years I’ve honed the best practices that work for my learning and working style (which happens to be visual and kinaesthetic, like a lot of people with dyslexia). So I take notes. Lots of notes. On my phone, in journals, on my chalk board... if I can’t see it it didn’t happen. I easily forget information unless I have a visual reminder so taking notes is vital. I also keep a bullet journal (you may have seen my flip-through on my YouTube channel) that allows me to oversee my day, week, month and year and keep track of my life. It’s perfect for me as I can customise it to suit my exact needs and change it up when I need to.

My creative journals are also important logs. I often feel stifled without an outlet or overwhelmed without a way to let out my creative fire. Creativity is one of my dyslexic superpowers that helps uplift all other aspects of my life and bring in a new perspective when working with others.

Being uneducated about dyslexia created a hard, confusing and self-punishing environment. Now knowing my Self a little better (a lot better) I’m connected with my inner world and can dive deep into self-love, acknowledgment, gratitude, empowerment and share my gifted dyslexic Self with the world.",40,800,blueollis

lately i’ve been doing the reprogramming work to truly align with my highest self in every situation i step into.
if i don’t think i can do that bc my heart doesn’t want to be there, then i won’t go!!
if i commit to something, i want to bring the light, the joy, the fun, the goodness inside of me and soak in the goodness of others.
when you raise your vibration, inevitably the vibration around you rises.
i’m not saying fake being happy when you’re not, because that wouldn’t be authentic either. but sometimes showing up as your truest self means being vulnerable and open about WHY you’re not feeling your best.
in doing so, you’ll give others permission to do the same.
you’ll also give them permission to rise up and align with their highest self in order to help you do the same.
this is earth school, people. it’s not easy but there’s no flunking. the only way to go is UP!! 💗

I knew this recipe would be great because these tostadas share all of the same qualities of a great taco: something hearty (refried beans), something creamy (avocado), something crisp (shredded cabbage and jicama), something tangy (pickled onions), and lots of fresh flavors.

This is more of a non-recipe than a recipe, but here’s what ya need 👉🏼heat your grill or grill pan and generously coat it in some high-heat oil, like coconut or avocado. Place your sausages and veggie skewers (load em’ up with whatever you want!) on the grill, rotating every 3 to 5 minutes to create grill marks. Serve and enjoy! 🍴 ⁣

But now, there's this big bad phrase that seeps into every thought and idea I ever have... CLIMATE EMERGENCY.⁣
⁣
In what I suppose is a rather pivotal piece in my both activism and online journey (link in my bio), I've written about why I'm questioning whether to let go of my childhood dream and why I believe that @londonfashionweek needs re-evaluating.⁣
⁣
If someone were to ask me now, ""Do you want to be a fashion designer?"", my answer would undoubtedly begin with the words, ""Yes, but...""⁣
⁣
In my opinion, those who have criticised @xr.boycottfashion @xrfashionaction's plans to disrupt London Fashion Week are missing a certain mindset that enables you to see past creativity and truly understand the crisis we are facing. And to say fast-fashion is the main issue, ignores how intrinsically linked LFW is to fast-fashion itself, with the British Fashion Council being supported by the likes of Arcadia Group (who own Topshop). ⁣
⁣
In an interview for Channel 4 News, Margaret Atwood just suggested that the ""Extinction Rebellion teenagers"" will be the ones who bring about change. Therefore, I am proud to be protesting against the industry which I spent my childhood wanting to break into. ⁣

These tortilla breads are THE BOMB and they’re only 3 ingredients 🙌🏻🧡 Adding mashed sweet potatoes to a simple spelt dough makes the tortillas softer and more flavorful than regular ones. It does take a little time to roll them, but it’s really easy and will definitely up-level your taco game 🌮🌮🌮 Plan it for a weekend when you wanna eat something special 👌🏼 Recipe below!
•
Sweet Potato Tortillas
makes ~7 tortilla breads
•
3 medium sweet potatoes
4-5 dl (1 2/3 - 2 cups) fine spelt flour
1 tsp salt
•
Method:
1.  Set oven to 200’C/390’F. Prick holes into the potatoes and roast for 45 min-1 hour or until completely cooked through. Let cool a bit.
2.  Remove skins from the potatoes and place in a bowl. Mash them together with the salt. Add the spelt flour, little by little, and work it in. Use your hands or a spatula. When you have a workable dough, divide it into 7-8 pieces. On a floured surface, roll out to ~3mm thin tortilla breads. Add more flour as needed.
3.  Toast the tortilla bread (one by one) in a dry, hot skillet on both sides until it’s got a bit of color. Carefully not to burn as they toast really fast! Place under a clean kitchen towel and spray with a little water. This step is essential, as it makes the tortillas soft enough to wrap around your filling. Repeat with the rest of the dough, removing any excess flour in the pan between rounds.
4. Serve with taco filling of choice!

Just because pigs like to soak in mud, doesn't mean they're dirty animals. They use the mud to thermoregulate, keep the bugs away and protect their skin from sunburn.⁠
⁠
On the contrary, pigs tend to be very clean animals. They keep their “bathroom"" as far away as possible from the areas where they eat and drink.⁠

mid air on the flight home yesterday, i experienced a newer lyme symptom of mine (we’ll get into that another day), and had a full blown panic attack in the airplane bathroom.

my heart started racing, the walls felt like they were caving in around me, and i completely blacked out.

i knew i could either stay in there and lose my mind, or try to get it together so i did everything i could to make the latter happen.

i looked into the mirror, regained my breath, called on my angels, and calmed myself down. i got back to my seat and laid down (whole row to myself 🙏🏻), and then it happened again- but much worse.

this time i broke out in full sweats and hives and all the color drained from my face. i was shaking like a leaf and my heart felt like it was on fire. it felt impossible to draw in a breath. again i had that familiar feeling of, “this is it. this is the end.”
.
i sat up and frantically gripped everything around me trying to find my sanity and calm. i fumbled with my phone and got a meditation on, and raggedly breathed my way back into my body.

in those moments, i am so grateful for my meditation and yoga practice. i knew that if i could focus on my breath, and get my mind off of the symptoms that spiraled me into the panic, i would be okay.

it was a ROUGH flight to say the least but today i am happy to be home, yet feeling all of the exhaustion and pains of lyme tenfold.

if you’ve ever felt this way, know you’re not alone. this too shall pass. ready for all of the rest and self care this weekend after that experience... so much love to you all. ✌🏻 #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit",188,3149,thebalancedblonde

According to @rare_org “human behaviour is both the cause and the solution to every major conservation challenge. Changing our behaviour is hard, but it is the single most important thing we can do to ensure nature’s survival.”

Today our youth behaved in an inspiring and motivating way by striking against climate change and climate negative policies! I was proud to show up as an ally to a generation of incredible thinkers, doers and powerful achievers. It gives me hope that the fight will not end until we see a lasting change, in our leaders, our policies and our attitude towards people and resources. I will always stand with our young adults and fight for their future alongside them. ⭐️🌟✨

If you want to learn more about how important behaviour change is I highly recommend @rare_org as a great resource - I’ve been chatting with them all week about the work they’re doing and it’s incredibly inspiring and has definitely informed the way I will proceed with my activism!!

⠀⁠
Apart from the incredible macros that the Beyond Burger yields, it stacks up rather well compared to a standard beef burger too! ⁠
⠀⁠
With less fat, more protein and no antibiotics or hormones - I will ALWAYS pick the beyond burger over the beef burger…⁠
⠀⁠
There is no doubt in my mind! ❌⁠
⠀⁠
However, I wouldn’t recommend eating Beyond Burgers too often, as they are heavily processed and I prefer to stick to whole plant foods for 99% of my time ⁠
⠀⁠
But, having the Beyond Burger served at so many restaurants now has made being vegan even more enjoyable!!⁠
⠀⁠
Have you tried the Beyond Burger yet? Let me know where you tried it! ⬇️⁠

So how about making this 100% vegan chocolate cake in time for the next episode? 👩‍🍳💓 Ingredients -

300g soya spread (baking & spreading) (room temperature)
300g fine raw cane sugar
1 tbsp vanilla extract
300g spelt flour
200g Plant-based alternative to yogurt sweetened with agave
2 tsp baking powder
75g cacao powder
75ml Rice-Coconut-Chocolate drink or Rice-Coconut drink
1 pinch of salt

Method -

Preheat the oven to 185°C

For the cake:
Beat the soya spread and sugar for 5 mins with a whisker or food processor, until you are left with a light texture and until the sugars is dissolved.
Add the vanilla and the yogurt and fold gently.
Sieve the flower in 3 x over the batter and gently fold until the flour is dissolved.
Do the same with the cacao powder.
Finally add the Rice-Coconut-Chocolate drink (or Rice-Coconut drink).
Stir well until you have a smooth batter.
In the meantime, grease 2 baking tins with a diameter of 18cm.
Cover them with a layer of flour.
Divide the batter equally over the tins and bake for 25 - 30 mins.
Let it cool for 5 mins in the tin and afterwards let it further cool outside the tin.

For the frosting:
Fill the bottom of a cooking pot with some water.
Put a bowl on top of the pot. Make sure the water does not touch the bowl.
Let the water come to boiling point, but don’t let it further boil.
Put the following ingredients in the bowl and stir until you have a shiny mixture and the chocolate is molten: 300g powdered sugar, 200g soya spread, 5 tbsp Rice-Coconut-Chocolate drink, 100g vegan chocolate, 2 tbsp cacao powder.
Let it cool.
Cover the top of 1 cake with part of the frosting.
Sprinkle with the raspberries, red berries + other berries.
Put the 2nd cake on top of this and gently push.
Generously cover the top with the frosting and decorate.
Enjoy! ⠀ .⠀

And if you care to share what that is, please enlighten us! ☀️I’m always so intrigued and inspired to hear what others do! Personally, when I’m drinking room temp water, adding a little lemon, maybe a little apple cider vinegar and some molasses first thing in the morning I feel at ultimate best! The other thing I do, is eat melons only on an empty stomach! I have always had sensitive digestion and knowing melons digest in 5 min where as everything else including other fruits take longer, they really do best first thing in the morning! 
For breakfast we almost always have a smoothie, the kids they might have oatmeal or toast too. (I feel better with just a litre sized smoothie) and that’s usually after the kids are in school. I try to exercise in the morning but if I can’t I do a quick dry brush (been extra into that lately)  to get the lymphatic fired up (feels so good after) and do a couple push ups or something to get the blood flowing- I can’t not do something physical... It makes everything better and I know that about myself (especially if baby’s been up a lot that night)! For the kids I notice such a huge direct correlation between good nutrition and happy dispositions! If they are nourished and hydrated they are angels! It’s when do much breads and empty calories (cereals) take over that I start to notice their pep damper! And happy kids are the absolute best energy and makes life that much more enjoyable which is one easy motivator to feed them good! They also always skateboard surf  or ride their bike before school to get their blood pumping too!
So that’s what’s going on over here! How about you?! (I should note - Shem and I are about the same most days! (And I should note we didn’t always have a supportive start to our days! Use to be more like bread and store bought waffles and cereals) - but definitely  gotten better over the years and it’s definitely made a big positive difference worth being amped on!😜🍇🍍🥥🥑💦 #morningroutine PS can you tell our kitchen is different! 🙌🏽",568,56856,earthyandy

Yes, I eat fast foods sometimes and on occasion I’ll cook up something less than nutrient-dense in the kitchen but this is usually for social reasons (and quite rare) and I always find myself looking forward to eating something simple, clean and refreshing.

I enjoy feeling lightness after I eat, thanking myself for the love I’ve given to my body, knowing my meal has helped me, not hindered me.

Everything is cooked over coals and it’s here I had possibly the best lamb chop of my life (definitely don’t skip the salads either, these are exceptional). Kiki’s will have a good 40 person queue throughout the entire day, but it couldn’t be more worth the wait (plus the boxes of wine and cool box of ice provide enough of a distraction)!

 I don’t wear them too often but I absolutely love being in a kurta. Wonder why I don’t wear one everyday🥰 Decided to draw my inspiration today from the Folk & Fusion trend in the Myntra Autumn Winter '19 collection. Funny enough, I was was inspired to whip up this rose pistachio cheesecake today the minute I had a look at this printed kurta which I paired with white bottoms.
Check out @Myntra App and tell us what inspires you.

I catch myself just standing, forgetting what I was doing or thinking 😅 It’s frustrating to feel like that on a Monday, cause normally I’m ready to hit the ground running and crush my to-do list early in the week 💪🏻 We’ve been in full on ”to do” mode all weekend, getting all the garden & cleaning projects done, so I guess I didn’t get the brain rest I needed either 🤷🏼‍♀️ This week is not v exciting, just a bunch of cooking, shooting and writing! Let’s have a look 👉🏼
•
⌲ Mon: Tested and shot a recipe for apple rings today! Flavored with various powders 🍎😛(more on stories!). Also tested a soup that turned out AMAZING 😍
⌲ Tue: Another day in the kitchen/studio, shooting and getting all creative! 👩🏼‍🍳Workout in the afternoon if there’s time 🏋🏼‍♀️
⌲ Wed: Office day! I rent a desk at a shared office space in town, where I spend about 2-3 days a week. My artist friend @amandamendiant also sits there so it’s nice to have company 🙃 Will edit photos & write blog posts! 👩🏼‍💻 Oh and talk to @withyohanna, planning upcoming retreats!
⌲ Thu: Another day in the kitchen, recipe testing & shooting 🥑🥕🥒
⌲ Fri: Back at the office to process the last content of this week. It’s nice to alternate between those two: creating - processing - creating - processing ☯️

This is because layer hens — and therefore their chicks — are a different breed to chickens that are bred and raised for meat production. ⁠
⁠
Millions of them are gassed to death on their first day of life. Worldwide approximately 7 billion day-old male chicks are culled per year.⁠

.
.
.
The line between the two can be SO thin. Here’s what I mean...
.
.
.
⭐️Playing it safe, doing what I know and what resonates with my lovely audience 💓can feel like a win. 🥇
.
⭐️Those instagram likes are SOOOOO desirable🥰, yet following a ‘formula’, even if it brings me ig hearts can feel like I’m losing too - I loose my sense of adventure, playfulness, experimentation and creative growth. 🥺
.
.
.
⭐️Doing something outside my comfort zone is scary 😅and if the shot doesn’t come out 100% the way I want it to, it feels like a fail😫. .
⭐️Yet on the other side of that is learning, problem solving and permission to try more new things.✨💪🏼✨
.
.
.
⭐️All of this to say I don’t know if I love or hate this shot🤔. Fried food is something I’ve always been afraid to photograph 😅- though I SO enjoyed eating these fried zucchini fritters/ bhajis trust you me😋- and shooting on THAT backdrop was hard, but I LOVE that I pushed the boat out and that I’m stretching myself. So there you have it #eatcaptureshare. ☺️

All this time I felt inadequate and not as ready as I needed to be in order to be part of the street activism community, believing that my quiet and introverted way of being was not the right way to “do” street activism... Activism is not just for people who are outgoing, comfortable talking with strangers or have the perfect response to all questions. It’s for everyone who wants to see peace and harmony and be part of the revolution that is manifesting it... Some of our most powerful leaders in history have been introverts Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks and Gandhi for example. They go to show the power of introverted leadership, leadership that doesn’t equate to being loud or dramatic but being softly-spoken and even at times quiet. This adds it’s own power because people can feel that you’re not there to speak to them because you enjoy the spotlight. You’re not there because you enjoy having these conversations, like being looked at or are seeking approval, you’re here because you have to be. There is a sense of urgency when someone whose body is screaming for them to stay home is taking to the streets, in perhaps their most uncomfortable environment, to speak out for someone in need. The message we portray besides that of our words is that this is something worth being uncomfortable for.” — excerpt from my speech ‘Introvert Activist’ given at @vegancampout 2019

Pasta is considered a processed food, I am not against processed foods in moderation, processed does not mean BAD❌Especially when used to your advantage. For example, I just had a day where I trained for 3.5 hours and burned A LOT of calories. That is when healthier processed foods like pasta & breads can come in handy as they are super calorie rich and helps me replenish what I burned much easier than if I were to eat only whole foods🥦
Processed foods with one ingredient is nowhere near as harmful as actual junk food with all sorts of strange artificial ingredients...
👉🏼Some processed foods I personally consider fine in moderation are things like pastas, breads, tofu, plant milks, nutritional yeast, dairy-free yogurt, bean burgers🍔
Ofcourse, I always recommend eating most of your calories from whole plant foods✌🏼🌱

The truth is, there is no fashion, as we know it, on a dead planet. ⁣
⁣
I was interviewed a few times whilst we - Extinction Rebellion - prepared to walk our funeral procession to 180 The Strand, where LFW is now held. Journalists asked me why I was there and I told them my story (and how it was my first fashion week despite being invited over the years) and said that this is about my future. It's as simple as that.⁣
⁣
At least in the UK, we aren't seeing extreme affects of the climate crisis *yet*. We've seen hot weather but some people are still seeing it as a time to rejoice we see torrential rain as typical for Britain and we most certainly do not connect the dots of this to industries such as fashion. No, it's not the main cause but it's one of many. ⁣
⁣
We need action NOW in always possible. That's why I'm here. That's why I'll be striking on Friday. That's why I'll continue to use my voice. (All while I'm dressed in second-hand and years old clothes, of course. I'll never put my wardrobe to rest and neither should you). 👗⚰️⁣📷: @tansyhoskins

⠀⁠
As some of you know, I absolutely LOVE ice cream, especially when I can make it super healthy and high in protein like this one!⁠
⠀⁠
All you need is these 4 ingredients and some liquid to reach the consistency you prefer!⁠
⠀⁠
✅ 3 cups of frozen Mango⁠
✅ 1 scoop @vivolife protein powder⁠
✅ 1 can Coconut Cream⁠
✅ 2 tbsp Maple syrup (you can use dates or an alternative sweetener too)⁠
+ some water/plant milk to make sure it blends well!⁠
⠀⁠
So, here are the instructions...:⁠
⠀⁠
1️⃣ Blend all ingredients in decent blender or food processor⁠
2️⃣ Pause, scrape down sides of the blender and continue⁠
3️⃣Add water or plant milk for desired consistency⁠
4️⃣ Serve into a tub and store in the freezer if you want your ice cream to be firm⁠
OR... Eat straight away! The choice is yours.⁠
⠀⁠
I 100% recommend you to try this and let me know how it goes!⁠

Last weekend I decided it had been TOO LONG since I made my beloved roasted butternut squash dish, complete with almond-pecan parm...and kale...and lots of garlic. Have you made it? Oh me oh my, it’s a show-stealing side I tell ya. (Making all the other dishes give the side-eye, heh. #butternutplease) .
.
Here’s a little summary of the comments I received when I served it to the fam:
.
Eric: Holy sh*t that’s hot!!! *burns mouth* (he never learns) and then “Butternut squash is so much better than pumpkin” (LOL...so random….I die)
.

Adriana, 3 years old: NO THANK YOUUUUUUU, as she skips away with Arlo’s toy in her grasp. Spotted 10 minutes earlier: downing a box of “circle crackers” (sigh)
.
Arlo, 1 year old: *screams and beats his hands in protest because he has to wait for the squash to cool* then proceeds to inhale it. He was nice enough to smash the leftover squash into his hair, and even tossed some squash over his shoulder for good luck.
.
Me: *screams and beats my hands in protest because I have to wait for it to cool* then eats 2 big servings. 🤣
.
.
*****MAKE-AHEAD TIP*****
.
Did you know you can prep this dish a couple days in advance? This is a fun trick for holiday meal prep when sanity is at an all time low (or is that just me). .
.
Simply chop the squash (I just said “simply” and “chop squash” in the same sentence...#fail) OR get your paws on some pre-chopped fresh butternut at the grocery store (bless their souls)...and throw it into the casserole dish with your oil, garlic, salt, parsley, etc. Wrap the casserole dish with foil and let it hang out in the fridge for a couple days, if you’re doing that make-ahead thang. Chop the kale (this time I doubled the amount and loved the extra greens!!) and put it in a tiny container or baggie in the fridge, as well as the almond-pecan parmesan. (Pro tip: you can make this “vegan parm” will all kinds of nuts and seeds...this time I used almonds and roasted/salted pepitas...it also works without the nutritional yeast, just in case you don’t have it on hand! I change it up all the time). Put that in the fridge too. Cook when ready",185,5712,ohsheglows

I whisked together a speedy dressing made with apple cider vinegar, pure maple syrup, olive oil, Dijon mustard, pink salt, and pepper. Just all to taste. So good! .
.
Another way to enjoy a hot & cold salad this fall is with my Crowd-Pleasing Tex Mex Casserole (recipe from my first cookbook).

I’m still in disbelief over receiving two gold awards, one for Health and Special Diets Cookbook of the year (Oh She Glows Every Day!), and a second honouring Oh She Glows as best Health and Special Diets Food Blog 2017. This year has been a trying one, and I’ve struggled with self-doubt as I try to find some sort of balance between motherhood and my career. The recognition is so meaningful and reminds me to keep going. We are often too hard on ourselves, especially in a creative field. I’m so grateful to be a part of this community, and can’t believe how much you have all changed my life. ❤️

This photo was taken by us in the Toronto harbour last summer and shows the tremendous amount of plastic waste filling up in our Great Lakes. Unfortunately this scene is an all too common sight along every coastline in the world nowadays and in order to change this situation it is going to take significant collective action. Not just by participating in things like beach cleanups or recycling more, but by outright refusing single use plastic waste as much as possible and by demanding that businesses and politicians eliminate these types of wasteful plastics from being created in the first place. This is a fight about banning or redesigning certain polluting products altogether and by starting a revolution against our throwaway culture. This is a fight about the health of our entire environment and every living thing, including your own health as well. If you live in the Great Lakes region your body is 70% Great Lakes water, the same water in this picture. But of course there are a lot more challenges facing our water than plastic pollution. Which is why we also challenge you to do things like change your diet and eat less meat and when you eat seafood to only support sustainable fisheries that are traceable and local if possible. Support environmental organizations and vote for politicians that take these issues seriously, hold the corporate polluters financially responsible and transition us away from fossil fuels. Talk about these issues with your friends and family and get outside and enjoy being around nature and water whenever you can! There is a lot be worried about these days but even more to be hopeful for. Happy World Water Day! 🌍 💧#worldwaterday",0,71,thewaterbrothers

We may be a day late but every day is Earth Day for us so... 🤷‍♂️ 🌍

If you want to take a simple action for the earth and water then we recommend choosing at least one day every week (or hopefully more!) to eat a plant based diet. Livestock production is responsible for the majority of global habitat loss and leaves less space for wild animals to flourish compared to plant production. It uses far more water as well. Livestock production is also responsible for about 15% of our greenhouse gas emissions. For those of you who already eat plant based foods every day then congrats! You already know why this is so important for both the planet and the welfare of farm animals themselves. Our bonus tip then is to cut down on food waste which affects nearly half of the food produced in Canada.

Eating meat itself is not inherently bad. It can be done sustainably and we should support those that farm responsibly, but it can’t be done on an industrial scale to feed meat intensive diets to 7 billion + people without causing irreparable harm to the natural world. It also will be very difficult to convince everyone to change their diets, especially for those who depend on small scale livestock farming to survive. Which is why it is so important for those of us who have the ability to change our diets start one day or meal at a time asap. If you want to learn more about these issues and some exciting emerging solutions, please check out our episode More Food, Less Water 🌎 💧#earthday",2,66,thewaterbrothers
